This is a model of a divider problem, where Participants are allowed to pick their favourite Things. These Things,
some of which may have a minimum or maximum number of Participants, should be divided among them, so that each
Participant is alotted a single Thing. Things may be mandatory, meaning that at least 1 Participant should be alotted
the thing (this may be so if the Things are tasks). Things may also have a minimum and a maximum number of Participants.
This is a model of a fair system, where each Participant's happiness is maximized, and unhappiness, if unavoidable,
is randomly alotted.
